# Restaurant Data Analysis Project - Level 3

## Overview

Welcome to Level 3 of the Restaurant Data Analysis project! In this phase, we dive deeper into predictive modeling, customer preference analysis, and advanced data visualization. The aim is to build and evaluate predictive models, understand customer preferences, and create insightful visualizations.

## Level 3: Achievements

### Task 1: Predictive Modeling

- **Regression Model Development**
  - Built a regression model to forecast restaurant ratings based on various features.
  - Implemented multiple algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
  - Compared the performance of different models to determine the most accurate predictor.

### Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis

- **Cuisine and Rating Analysis**
  - Analyzed the relationship between cuisine types and restaurant ratings.
  - Identified the most popular cuisines based on the number of votes.
  - Determined which cuisines tend to receive higher ratings, providing valuable insights into customer preferences.

### Task 3: Data Visualization

- **Visualization Techniques**
  - Created engaging visualizations to represent the distribution of restaurant ratings using histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots.
  - Compared average ratings across different cuisines and cities.
  - Visualized relationships between various features and the target variable, enhancing the understanding of the data.
